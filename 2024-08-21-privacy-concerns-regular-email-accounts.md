# Privacy Concerns with Regular Email Accounts: Protecting Your Digital Communication

Email communications have become a major part of everyone’s life today, both outside and inside the workplace. As much as this average email user takes advantage of such accounts, it is important to know the associated privacy concerns. In this article we examine in detail the risks and challenges users encounter when using Conventional Email services, and how well these challenges can be avoided.

## Regular Emails Are Careless And Poised To Attack

Conventional email accounts are easy to use, but that does not mean that they are safe by any means. They are at risk of being *** compromised in terms of different forms of violate methods of privacy and threat security.*** Regular mail can be security risks in that the owners of the mail service do not assume responsibility of the email users. The user, therefore, faces the risk that their emails and related personal data could be in a danger zone and prone to hacking and other cases of abuse.

And also, basic email services and protocols in particular SMTP were not created to enforce security as the main object. Therefore, most emails sent via a normal account can practically be snooped on or read by unauthorized personnel over the mouth particularly during the sending from the user’s point unless security measures like encrypting the transmission are taken.

##Data Mining and Targeted Advertising 

The majority of such free web-based email services monetarily benefit from such targeted advertising. This is achieved by sifting through the emails of users to get details such as their communication styles, interests and even personal information. Although such services claim that such a process is not intrusive, there are massive issues related to privacy. The analysis of your emails turns them into awesome pieces of information that can be sold to advertisers, and your private life may be at stake. 

This practice of data mining can make users lose some privacy and autonomy. For example, when a user sends emails that contain some content which can be interpreted as an advertisement, such users are likely to see ads of the company that they have emailed. They feel their privacy has been invaded by the said companies. Additionally, email scanning can reveal sensitive user information which can be further misconstrued as simple data aggregation for marketing purposes. It raises the question of how the information in such user profiles will be used down the road and how this intrusive practice can be updated. 

##Phishing and Social Engineering Attacks 

Regular email accounts can be easily hijacked through phishing and such social engineering tactics. A notable number of these attacks are targeted at email service users probably because people tend to be more trusting towards these providers. Such attacks can be directed towards stealing a person’s identity, obtaining money or access to important personal and business accounts.

The absence of any strong components ensures that many regular emails do not put any risks of attackers impersonating the actual entities. Users can be targeted with phishing emails which can come from trusted email accounts, thus, they may end up giving out sensitive information or downloading viruses. 

## Government Surveillance and Legal Requests

Another negative aspect of having normal email accounts is what can be termed as data surveillance and requests for data by the authorities. Email services may be forced to provide information of users to legal bodies or the government which most of the time the users do not consent to it. 

In particular, this matter arose after the materials released by Edward Snowden regarding programs aimed at the collection of information on a number of people. They began to discover threats posed to your email, such as the potential that emails sent by users could be scrutinized and stored by spy agencies, leading to the infringement of civil liberties and the possible misuse of the information gathered.

Most normal email services do not have end-to-end encryption as a preset option which is normally the case, hence while your emails are sent over the internet they may be encoded, however, more often than not, the encrypted mail is abated to an unencrypted form and archived in the servers of the said service provider. This exposes your emails to depending on the accessibility of the mail service’s employees, invading hackers, or any other person who logs into your account. 

The glaring breach of failure to provide end to end encryption by the company means that this company has the ability to read any users email including business one emails and that could be actually bad if the company for any reasons changes its policies or unwillingly has to provide its partners some information.

## Data Retention and Account Deletion

A good number of users will not pay attention to their email providers and will never think about what the retention policies entail. Even though emails may be deleted or an account closed, an email provider may hold copies of messages and information for an extended period. Such long retention of data causes exposure of this information in future likely causes where this information is protected against currently preventing or seeking at reaching unauthorized persons.

Also, it is clear that erasing an email account and all its content and applications is not always possible and, when it is possible, it is generally difficult and time-consuming, allowing for time lapses in which one’s communication history can be accessed and annoyance due to persistence bias because one was trying to wipe it out. 

## Cross-Platform Tracking and Integration

With devices advancing in technology, it is common for services associated with regular email accounts to come adjoined with other platforms and services. However, in such scenarios, there comes the question of privacy. Your email use may now not be hard to account as a part of your online use that includes browsing the web, using apps, and other internet activities.

Hearing the term cross-platform tracking is enough for preparation for a breach of privacy on most columns of digital life such that doing everyday activities becomes a chore of differentiating personal interactions from business-related ones or how information about an individual particularly concerning their behavior across different platforms flows.

## Protecting Your Privacy: Alternative Solutions

In light of the outlined concerns on privacy, many users are opting for alternative communication methods that are less prone to invasion. One such solution is the use of temporary email services like [Tempmail.so](https://tempmail.so). These services use email addresses that only last a few minutes in order to complete a task and therefore decreases the amount of truth a person has to endorse online to a minimum.

Temporary email services possess certain features that may prove to be more advantageous than traditional email accounts with respect to privacy concerns:

1. There is no need to provide any personal information.

2. The average temporary email is only available for limited time hence the decrease of any possibility of storage of data for so long.

3. They avoid spams and communicational marketing that is undesired.

4. They enable some of the internet uses that do not require common email addresses without giving one’s details.

Temporary email services, just like any other kinds of services, do not satisfy all communication purposes. However, they can be an effective means of ensuring privacy when using the internet for various purposes.

## Conclusion: The Trade-off Between Comfort and the Optimal Level of Privacy

In the course of using the offered communication services, there is very high risk of privacy especially for those who Juliet communication through the use of emails. While the benefits of using such services are very appealing, the services are often very irresponsible in respect to providing sufficient comfort and better internet control by the users.

Being aware of these threats and investigating other ways such as the use of temporary email services, encryption tools, and privacy-oriented email service providers can also help users secure their email and privacy. Going forward, it will be imperative to be aware of and active with developments in email privacy as the technology envelopes our lives.
